<p> Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, 
    to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. The show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. 
    The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were 
    Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.</p>

<p>Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being "the first true 
    'ensemble' show. The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves 
    in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover 
    photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck 
    reported that he sometimes felt left out.</p>

    <h3>The main cast members</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jennifer Aniston</li>
        <li>Courteney Cox</li>
        <li>Lisa Kudrow</li>
        <li>Matt LeBlanc</li>
        <li>Matthew Perry</li>
        <li>David Schwimmer</li>
      </ul> 
<p>The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David 
    Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book Friends 'Til the End, each separately acknowledged in interviews 
    that the cast had become their family.</p>

<p>Although the producers thought of Friends as "only a TV show", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of Friends during the 
    series's run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "The Rachel" and copied around the world.Joey's catchphrase, "How you doin'?", 
    became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced 
    the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word 
    "so" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the 
    American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for 
    sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.</p>

<p> Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends ranked within the top ten of the final 
    television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, 
    and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched series finale in television history,
    and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.</p>

<p> Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International 
    English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve 
    their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager 
    Jürgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.</p>
